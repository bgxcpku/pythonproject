This is a stupid example text. I'm just going to type for a little while until I feel like there's a reasonable amount of text in here. Isn't Python just great? One thing that I just realized as I'm typing this is that Our sentence counter will only grab sentences that end in one specific string. This means that if we set the sentence separator to be ". " (<--- our parser will think that's the end of a sentence, ha!), then we won't count sentences that end in other punctuation marks, like "?" or "!". What a shame.
